      <h2>Military Guide: Introduction</h2>

<p>Military units are the soldiers used in battle, acting an essential role in the game. There are five classes of military units in the game. They are light units, heavy units, fast units, ranged units, and artillery units. They each have different properties, and players need to change their play style and tactics depending on which units they use most.</p>

<p>To train a unit, you have to build their specific barracks/building after having researched the technology. An example is to have researched Spears, built a Spearfighter Barracks, and then you can train Spearfighters from this military building. A barracks can train and hold two units after being built, but it has two more slots to be unlocked using coins and supplies. The fifth slot needs diamonds to unlock. This means the most a barracks can hold is 5 units.</p>

Some units gain an attack and/or defense bonus when on a certain type of terrain. For example, Spearfighters gain 2 defense bonus when on the “bushes” type of terrain and Stone Thrower gain 1 attack bonus when on the “hills” type. These bonuses are often similar for all units of a similar class but this is not always true (especially in the Industrial Age)

Some classes gain bonuses against other classes, giving great advantage against them. For example, a Legionnaire will gain both an attack and defense bonus while fighting Light Unit Class units, such as a Soldier. These bonuses are often critical in deciding victory or defeat in a battle.

Units deal less damage in battle as their health decreases, but after a battle ends any damaged units will slowly recover. For all units except Spearfighters, the time remaining for a given unit to heal is 1/10 of its training time per bar of health. If the unit was originally trained in a barracks, the time remaining for a damaged unit to be fully healed is displayed within the barracks that trained it (as long as that barracks is not currently training a new unit).

A detailed description of each of the units:</p>


Bronze Age
Light Units Light Unit (7/7/1/14) Spearfighter: First unit a player uses in game. Two unattached Spearfighters are provided to the player in the opening quests. Good, balanced, all purpose unit. Useful all through the Bronze Age even after unlocking the Warrior. It is the cheapest unit in the game, with fastest build/heal times. This makes it great fodder even after the player have heavy units. It takes only seconds instead of minutes to build/heal.

Heavy Units Heavy Unit (6/10/1/11) Warrior: High stats in defense and very tough. At end of age when a player becomes better they can replace light units. It is the perfect replacement for light units since they will not get much trouble from ranged units in this age. One can never go catastrophically wrong with heavy units in this age.

Fast Units Fast Unit (8/5/1/22) Horseman: Moderate stats for a melee unit. Not recommended for any serious battle. Still recommend recruiting at the end of the age to experiment with how they work. Light/heavy units are better in all ways except speed and attack.

Ranged Units Ranged Unit (5/3/5/12) Slinger: Light damage, easily destroyed and short ranged. Its range of five is matched by heavy unit’s move of 5.5 making it unable to stay away from them unless there is rough terrain in the way. Suggested to only use a few per battle. The player can use more as they get better with them and are experienced in combat.

Artillery Units Artillery Unit (3/2/12/6) Stone Thrower: Very low stats. Artillery unit is best against ranged classes because they have the lowest defense. The range is long enough to hit most units but not guaranteed to hit every unit. The AI does not use this artillery unit much, nor do players, especially with the bronze age being so short. Worth using a few for attacking ranged units. At the beginning of the game, one is provided to the player for free. It can help players practice with Artillery units.

Iron Age
Light Units Light Unit (9/9/1/16) Soldier: Still very reliable. Gains movement, attack and defense. A light Unit can always act as a replacement for the previous age’s heavy units. The extra speed helps a lot to be able to charge both ranged units and artillery units.

Heavy Units Heavy Unit (8/13/1/11) Legionnaire: Heavy Unit gains a ton of defense, but, because of the more powerful ranged units, will not replace the soldier when engaging ranged units. Best used in specific situations when engaging a large amount of light/fast units.

Fast Units Fast Unit (9/8/1/22) Mounted Warrior: Doesn’t gain speed, but gains +1 attack and +3 defense to put it on par with Light Units, it now actually works very well against Ranged Units and Artillery Units. But because of the fact that it is inferior against soldiers and legionnaires, it may only be able to place one attack each battle.

Ranged Units Ranged Unit (10/4/5/12) Archer: +4 Attack and +1 Defense. The Archer is the most successful unit in the iron age and also better than the mounted archer of the EMA. Not only heavy units, but also light and even fast units–which actually have defense and attack bonuses against them–are vulnerable against archers. The range is not vital and only keeps out heavy units, but this won’t be much of a problem since the attack power is very high. Also, 8 Archers are good for defense, and can beat 50% of fights until High Middle Ages. This range does not change and is less than heavy unit’s making them vulnerable. Another passive benefit is the fact that an Archer’s Range is a very small building (2X2), so it is very easy to train many of them (like 12 archers over three buildings).

Artillery Units Artillery Unit (4/3/13/6) Ballista: Gain +1 range. This makes is a viable unit. Now it can move and nearly reach any artillery units the enemy has. Use four Ballistas and four Archers for offense: use the Archers to engage most enemy units without the danger of retaliation, and use the Ballistas to take out enemy artillery and archers: one shot from a Ballista to an Archer will make the Archer a one-hit- kill if hit by another Archer next round. Also works in reverse order. Also, using seven Artillery Units and one Fast Unit can be very effective: use Fast Unit to lead the enemy on a wild goose chase while the Artillery pounds their units.

Early Middle Ages
Light Units Light Unit (13/13/1/16) Mercenary: +4 attack and defense. It indirectly becomes more useful as a counter to fast units since fast units will be more common now. It is capable of resisting the damage of archers and are also superior to the old legionnaires.

Heavy Units Heavy Unit (12/18/1/11) Armored Infantry: There is a large gap between its defense and the attack of other units in the age. It can take a beating from any unit in the age. Also, since the short ranged units are gaining an actual arrears in this age, it can’t be countered by the ranged attacks and this makes it very common. It can be used in many more situations than the legionnaire could in the iron age.

Fast Units Fast Unit (12/13/1/22) Heavy Cavalry: These stats are on par with Light Units. Movement does not change and is less than that of the Mounted Archer. It is decent, but, since ranged units don’t necessarily have to be countered in this age, it is not very effective. Both the Mercenary and the Armored Infantry are superior to it in melee.

Ranged Units Ranged Unit (9/6/5/22) Mounted Archer: The Mounted Archer is a very different unit from the Archer of the previous age. In a change to the actual nature of the game itself, it has been updated and strengthened without an announcement to players. In contrast to Archers, they are not capable of effectively piercing the armor of most units.Its previous stats made it a unit to be avoided, and most players stuck with Iron Age Archers. Now, the Mounted Archer is basically the Iron Age Archer on a horse, with higher defense. However, though it is able to hit enemy units on turn one in most battles, its high speed is more a disadvantage than an advantage, as this causes it to have to take the active role, while Ranged Units are more effective used defensively.

Artillery Units Artillery Unit (6/3/13/6) Catapult: Not much change. It is indirectly less useful because fewer players use Mounted Archers so there are fewer types units for them to effectively counter. It is also extremely vulnerable to said Mounted Archer, which can reach it in turn one. Still worth using a few, but less than in other ages.

High Middle Ages
Light Units Light Unit (20/16/1/16) Berserker: +7 attack, +3 defense. This is the only time it does not have equal stats. It does tons of damage, more than other units, and will be used more. It is perfect to take the active role on the battlefield. With Fast Units being better, these will be more common.

Heavy Units Heavy Unit (16/26/1/12) Heavy Infantry: Speed +1. This makes it much better and able to catch up with light units and charge Ranged Units with small ranges. A big gap starts to form between its attack and its defense where before these values were more similar. It becomes very tanky and the Ranged Unit (short range) is not guaranteed to kill it in two hits.

Fast Units Fast Unit (16/17/1/24) Knight: Speed +1. It also gains balanced stats and becomes at least equal to Ranged Units with shorter ranges. Its stats are a bit behind, but it is significantly better. It will nearly be able to kill Artillery Units with one attack. This again will make it somewhat more common. The added speed allows it to easily outmaneuver any unit. It is still surprisingly vulnerable against the Crossbowmen. Gets the special ability Chivalry, gains bonus to attack and defense when it is the only unit with chivalry in your army. When having, for example, four Knights, if one loses three of those knights during the battle on the map, this will active the ability Chivalry, to increase both attack and defense of the remaining Knight. It is very good for defense, since Ranged and Artillery Units are not able to defend themselves effectively against a charging Knight.

Ranged Units Ranged Unit (20/10/5/12) Crossbowman: Same range and movement speed as Iron Age Archers. It is superior to almost every unit, including Berserkers and Knights (even Knights will be very vulnerable against Crossbowmen). The damage is nearly twice as much as an Iron Age Archer and defense is nearly 2.5x as much as an Iron Age Archer for those who stuck with them. It is also able to defend itself very effectively against older Ranged Units and Catapults, but even Mercenaries will not cause tremendous damage to it. There will be many of them but still some people will be traumatized by mounted archers and not use many.

Artillery Units Artillery Unit (9/4/14/6) Trebuchet: Range +1. Many will decide to use them with the extra range making it so they can hit any opposing unit on turn one. It is actually the only unit that can effectively to take out Crossbowmen, much like the Ballista in the iron age. But it will also cause surprisingly much damage to Berserkers and Mercenaries. It will be more common and a player may see other players defend or attack with eight of them.

Late Middle Ages
Light Units Light Unit (25/25/1/16) Great Sword Warrior: +5 attack, +9 defense. Light Unit is amazing this age. It can be used as both offense and defense, and Light Unit + Fast Unit is one of the hardest defenses this age to take out. Because Fast Units are able to assassinate Ranged Units and Artillery Units, Light Units will be necessary to take out Fast Units. Even the Heavy Infantry is not able to defend against it.

Heavy Units Heavy Unit (23/33/1/12) Imperial Guard: The gap between defense and attack widens more. It is very tanky and Ranged Units are not guaranteed to kill it in two hits. It will be extremely common.

Fast Units Fast Unit (22/25/1/24) Heavy Knight: Only a bit lower stats than Light/Heavy Units. It can now hit kill an Artillery or Ranged Unit with only one hit, making it much more valuable and common. Light Unit + Fast Unit this age is one of the hardest defenses to break. Same special ability as knight.

Ranged Units Ranged Unit (24/12/6/12) Longbow Archer: Range +1. The range of six is enough to keep it out of reach of heavy units and also of light units if there is a lot of rough terrain in the way. There will be a huge rise in its numbers and it will be very common, filling the slot of those deciding to use the Artillery against the huge defense of Trebuchets. Ranged Unit + Artillery Unit can also win most fights if used correctly.

Artillery Units Artillery Unit (13/4/12/6) Cannon: Range -2. As with mounted archers some will decide not to use this unit for the disadvantage of range. It does more damage, but the range will be an issue. However, most do use this unit, because of the huge defense of Trebuchets, but the lack of range can be compensated for by moving it during battle. Ranged Unit + Artillery Unit can win most fights if used correctly. Gets the special ability Dug-in, receives defense bonus if the enemy is more than two tiles from away it. The Dug-in bonus is most effective against Ranged Unit and Artillery Unit attackers.

Colonial Age
Light Units Light Unit (35/35/1/16) Ranger: It has the highest stats for Light Units up to this age. It is durable enough to take a few hits still and do some damage, making it very dangerous. It gains the special ability Stealth. This makes it impossible to target when in forests unless the attacking unit is next to it. This makes it nearly immune to ranged attacks and, since on forests it gains defense, it can face heavy units and win.

Heavy Units Heavy Unit (28/40/2/12) Grenadier: Range +1. It gains range of two, which means it can attack Light Units and Fast Units without fear of retaliation. It can also retaliate against any ranged attack at range of two. Many people will want to use them for this fact alone. Fast Unit + Heavy Unit is a very potent defense this age that cannot easily be countered.

Fast Units Fast Unit (28/40/1/24) Dragoon: It has defense equivalent to the Heavy Units. It shines at this age and is comparable to Light/Heavy units and can replace them depending on the situation. It now easily counters Ranged Units and people are wary of using as many ranged classes. Fast Unit + Heavy Unit is a very potent defense this age that cannot easily be countered. Loses the Chivalry ability.

Ranged Units Ranged Unit (30/18/7/12) Musketeer: Range +1. High damage and added range, so it has enough range to keep out Heavy units and also Light units if there is the some rough terrain in the way. It gets trolled hard by Light Units due to Stealth. It is not nearly as durable as the melee units so it will be in every fight but not in super high numbers.

Artillery Units Artillery Unit (14/6/15/8) Field Gun: Range +3, speed +1. The largest range jump in the game. It has enough range to hit nearly any unit on the map, without moving. With its added speed it now acts between previous ages artillery units making it able to dominate any earlier age artillery units. The only bad thing is that it gets trolled hard by Light Units due to Stealth, but many people will use more of them and defending with eight on the battlefield will be common. The damage is very low compared to other defenses so it is only effective vs other ranged classes. The range and speed bonus will make it very common despite the low damage. Same special ability as cannon.

Industrial Age
Light Units Light Unit (28/37/6/16) Jaeger Infantry: Attack -7 Defense +2 Range +5. The added range makes it able to take out Fast Units at a range without fear of retaliation. It has the special ability stealth. This makes it impossible to target when on forests unless the attacking unit is next to it. This makes this unit nearly immune to ranged attacks and since on forests they gain defense and can face Heavy Units and win. This unit changes the Light Melee Class.

Heavy Units Heavy Unit (35/35/6/10) Howitzer: Attack +7, Defense -5, Range +4, Speed -1. Its new ability allows it to ignore Stealth (Light Unit’s ability), and damage increases if it is closer to the target. This unit changes the Heavy Melee Class. Instead of focusing on tanking, it focuses on damage, mostly damage on Light Units. Now, the howitzer is basically a cross between a Colonial Age Heavy Unit and an Industrial Age Artillery Unit.

Fast Units Fast Unit (40/40/1/24) Lancer: This unit has the highest stats up to this age, at a cost of having a range of one when every other unit in this age has a range of at least six. It is still useful to charge out ranged classes, and its damage is very high. The only thing bad about it is the range, but its movement is generally enough.

Ranged Units Ranged Unit (38/25/8/12) Rifleman: Added damage and range are not bad, but are not enough to compensate for the entire age’s increase in range. Now this unit can’t stay out of range of any unit and can be taken down somewhat easily.

Artillery Units Artillery Unit (18/9/15/8) Breech Loader: Gets a boost in attack and defense. No boost in range, but it doesn’t need any. Due to every unit except Fast having at least Range six, It is not as effective as previous Artillery Units, since it will soon die against melee attacks or at two spaces. Same special ability as Cannon and Field Gun.

Progressive Era
Light Units Light Unit (40/48/9/16) Conscript: Gets increases in both attack and defense from the Industrial Age. Movement speed stay the same and range is increased. Loses the Stealth ability. Gets the special ability Close Quarters, gains attack bonus when attacking an adjacent field.

Gets the special ability Dug-in, receives a defense bonus when the enemy is more than two tiles away from it. This ranged unit has same range as Stone Thrower and Cannon. This unit changes the Ranged Class.

Artillery Units Artillery Unit (?/?/?/?), TBA: TBA

All Ages
Light Units Light unit (100/1/1/14), Rogue: This is a special unit. With its 100 Attack, it can one-hit any unit with less than 10 Defense. Its ability is annoying, though. If it gets hit, it does not die if you have a non-Rogue unit. Instead, it randomly transforms into one of your remaining units that is not a Rogue. If you do not have a non-Rogue member, it will die in one hit. This can work out nicely if the Rogue transforms into a Knight against an army of Crossbowmen, but not very nicely if it is far out and gets transformed into a Trebuchet, resulting in a quick death. It takes no resources to train, but it takes 24 hours to train in a Rogue Hideout.

Fast Units / Heavy Units Fast Unit / Heavy Unit (varies with age), Champion: It is a fast unit, but from the Postmodern Era and onwards it becomes a heavy unit. It is similar to the fast unit above it with chivalry enabled, or just a fast unit in the current age with identical stats.

Light Units Light unit (10/10/1/14), Military Drummer: This unit cannot be killed with one hit because of its ability Morale, while the enemy works against it 10-10. This makes all friendly units start a battle with one point of armor and does not stack, meaning one extra hit point per friendly unit and a total of 11 hit points for this unit. It can be killed with two hits. This special unit costs 150 coins and 150 supplies, and takes 24 hours to train.

Heavy Units Heavy unit (11/11/1/12), Color Guard: This unit is vaguely like the military drummer. It has ability Rally (all friendly units start a battle with 12% attack and defense bonus, does not stack).
